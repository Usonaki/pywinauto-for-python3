APPLICATION TODO's
============================================================================
* Create a class that makes it easy to deal with a single window  (e.g. no application)

* Allow apps to be started in a different thread so we don't lock up
  - this is being done already - the problem is that some messages cannot
    be sent across processes if they have pointers (so we need to send a 
    synchronous message which waits for the other process to respond 
    before returning)

* Message traps - how to handle unwanted message boxes popping up?
  a) Wait for an Exception then handle it there
  b) set a trap waiting for a specific dialog

*  Implement an opional timing/config module so that all timing can be customized

* Handle adding reference controls (in that they should be the controls used for finding windows)

* Add referencing by closest static (or surrounding group box?)

* Find the reference name of a variable .e.g so that in Dialog._write() we 
  can know the variable name that called the _write on (this we don't have
  to repeat the XML file name!)

Investigate using any of the following
  BringWindowToTop
  EnumThreadWindows
  GetGUIThreadInfo
  GetTopWindow

# a) Dialogs returned from App (dialog)
#    should respond to _ctrl and their own actions
# b) Controls returned from Dialogs
#    should respond to _ctrl and their own actions
# c) Dialogs should be able to respond to calls of
#    FindControl
# d) Apps should be able to respond to calls of
#    FindDialog
# e) Dialogs need to be able to respond to MenuSelect

# app.dlgTitle
# app._Dialog(dlgSearchParams): raises WindowNotFound, WindowAmbiguous

# dlg.ControlTitle
# dlg._Control(ctrlSearchParams)

# dlg._Menu(menupath).Select()
# OR???
# dlg._Menu.File.Open.Select()

# dlg._.IsVisible
# dlg.Close()

# ctrl._.IsVisible
# ctrl.Click()



#App.Dialog.Control.Action()
#or App.Dialog.Action()
