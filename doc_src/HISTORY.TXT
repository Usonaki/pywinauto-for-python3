0.X.X Significant refactoring
------------------------------------------------
XX-Feb-2006

    * Not all top level windows now have a FriendlyClassName of "Dialog".
      I changed this because it made it hard to get windows of a particular
      class. For example the main Notepad window has a class name of "Notepad".
      
      This was primarily implemented due to work I did getting the System Tray.
      
    * Added support for a new control PopupMenuWrapper for  context menu's
    
    * Renamed StatusBarWrapper.PartWidths() to PartRightEdges() as this is more
      correct
      
    * Changed HwndWrapper.Text() and SetText() to WindowText() and 
      SetWindowText() respectively to try and make it clearer that it is 
      the text returned by GetWindowText and not the text that is visible 
      on the control. This change also suggested that EditWrapper.SetText()
      be changed to SetEditText() (though this is not a hard requirement
      EditWrapper.SetText() still exists - but may be deprecated.
      
    * Allow access to non text controls using the closest Text control.
      This closest text control will normally be the static/label associated
      with the control. For example in Notepad, Format->Font dialog, the 1st
      combobox can be refered to as "FontComboBox" rather than "ComboBox1"
      
    * 
    
    * 
    
    * Added yet more unit tests - now a total of 80/84 tests.


0.2.0 Significant refactoring
------------------------------------------------
06-Feb-2006

    * Changed how windows are searched for (from application)
      This chage should not be a significant change for users
    
    * Started adding unit tests (and the have already uncovered bugs 
      that been fixed). They also point to areas of missing functionality
      that will be addded with future updates
    
    * Changed from property access to Control attributes to function access
      If your code was accessing properties of controls then this might be a
      significant change! The main reasons for doing this were due to the
      inheritability of properties (or lack there-of!) and the additional 
      scafolding that was required to define them all.
      
    * Updated the ``DialogWrapper.MenuSelect()`` method to notify the parent 
      that it needs to initialize the menu's before it retrieves the items
      
    * Added functionality to associate 'non-text' controls with the 'text' 
      control closest to them. This allows controls to be referenced by::
      
        app.dlg.<Nearby_text><Window_class>
      
      e.g. to reference the "Footer" edit control in the Page Setup dialog 
      you could use::
       
        app.PageSetup.FooterEdit
      
    * Added a MoveWindow method to HwndWrapper
    
    * Did some more cleanup (fixing pylint warnings) but still not finished

    * Added some better support for .NET controls (not to be considered final)
    
    


0.1.3 Many changes, few visible
------------------------------------------------
15-Jan-2006

    * Wrote doc strings for all modules, classes and functions
    * Ran pychecker and pylint and fixed some errors/warning
    * changed ::
       
          _connect, _start, _window, _control, _write 
          
      respectively to ::
       
          connect_, start_, window_, connect_, write_ 
          
      If you forget to change ``_window``, ``_connect`` and ``_start`` then you will probably get the following error. ::
      
         TypeError: '_DynamicAttributes' object is not callable
         
    * pywinauto is now a package name - you need to import it or its modules
    * Changes to the code to deal with pywinauto package name
    * Fixed searching for windows if a Parent is passed in
    * Added Index to retrieved MenuItem dictionary
    * Added a check to ensure that a windows Handle is a valid window
    * Refactored some of the methods in common_controls
    * Refactored how FriendlyClassName is discovered (and still not really happy!

    * Updated Readme (original readme was incorrect)
    * Added clipboard module
    * Fixed DrawOutline part of tests.__init__.print_bugs
    * Added a NotifyParent to HwndWrapper
    * Make sure that HwndWrapper.ref is initialized to None
    * Refactored some methods of ComboBox and ListBox
    * Updated Combo/ListBox selection methods
    * Removed hardcoded paths from test_application.py
    * Added section to save the document as UTF-8 in MinimalNotepadTest
    * Fixed EscapeSpecials and UnEscapeSpecials in XMLHelpers
