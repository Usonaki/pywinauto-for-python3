0.2.0 Significant refactoring
------------------------------------------------
XX-Feb-2006

    * Changed how windows are searched for (from application)
      This chage should not be a significant change for users
    
    * Started adding unit tests (and the have already uncovered bugs 
      that been fixed). They also point to areas of missing functionality
      that will be addded with future updates
    
    * Changed from property access to Control attributes to function access
      If your code was accessing properties of controls then this might be a
      significant change! The main reasons for doing this were due to the
      inheritability of properties (or lack there-of!) and the additional scafolding
      that was required to define them all.
      
    * Updated the ``DialogWrapper.MenuSelect()`` method to notify the parent that it
      needs to initialize the menu's before it retrieves the items
      
    * Added functionality to associate 'non-text' controls with the 'text' control
      closest to them. This allows controls to be referenced by::
      
        app.dlg.ClosetextWindowclass
      
      e.g. to reference the "Footer" edit control in the Page Setup dialog you could
      use::
       
        app.PageSetup.FooterEdit
      
        


0.1.3 Many changes, few visible
------------------------------------------------
15-Jan-2006

    * Wrote doc strings for all modules, classes and functions
    * Ran pychecker and pylint and fixed some errors/warning
    * changed ::
       
          _connect, _start, _window, _control, _write 
          
      respectively to ::
       
          connect_, start_, window_, connect_, write_ 
          
      If you forget to change ``_window``, ``_connect`` and ``_start`` then you will probably get the following error. ::
      
         TypeError: '_DynamicAttributes' object is not callable
         
    * pywinauto is now a package name - you need to import it or its modules
    * Changes to the code to deal with pywinauto package name
    * Fixed searching for windows if a Parent is passed in
    * Added Index to retrieved MenuItem dictionary
    * Added a check to ensure that a windows Handle is a valid window
    * Refactored some of the methods in common_controls
    * Refactored how FriendlyClassName is discovered (and still not really happy!
