====================
ATTRIBUTE RESOLUTION
====================

TWO LEVELS 
 * application.member (Python resolves)
 	an attribute of application object
 * application.dialog
 	a dialog reference

THREE LEVELS
 * application.member.attr (Python resolves)
 	another attribute of the previous member
 * application.dialog.member
 	a member of the dialog object
 * application.dialog.control
	a control on the dialog

FOUR LEVELS (leaving out Python resolved)
 * application.dialog.member.member
 * application.dialog.control.member
 
 
DELAYED RESOLUTION FOR SUCCESS
Taking the example 
	app.dlg.control.action()
If we leave out syntax and programming errors there are still a number of reasons why it could fail.

dlg might not be found
control might not be found
either dlg or control may be disabled

dialog and control may be found but on the wrong dialog (e.g. in Notepad you can bring up 2 "Page Setup" dialogs both with an OK button)

One solution would just be to add a "sleep" before trying to find each new dialog (to ensure that it is there and ready) - but this will mean lots of unnecessary waiting.

So the solution I have tried is:
 - perform the complete attribute access resolution at the latest possible time
 - if it fails then wait and try again
 - after a specified timeout fail raising the original exception.
 
This means that in the normal case you don't have unnecessary waits - and in the failure case - you still get an exception with the error.

Also waiting to do resolution as late as possible stops errors where an earlier part of the path succeedes - but finds the wrong item.

So for example if  finds the page setup dialog in Notepad
# open the Printer setup dialog (which has "Page Setup" as title)
app.PageSetup.Printer.Click()

# if this runs too quickly it actually finds the current page setup dialog
# before the next dialog opens, but that dialog does not have a Properties
# button - so an error is raised.
# because we re-run the resolution from the start we find the new pagesetup dialog.
app.PageSetup.Properties.Click()



==================
WRITING TO DIALOGS
==================
We need a way of making sure that the dialog is active without having to access a control on it.
e.g. 
	app.MainWin.MenuSelect("Something That->Loads a Dialog")
	app.Dlg._write("dlg.xml")

or a harder problem:
	app.PageSetup.Printer.Click()
	app.PageSetup._write("pagesetup.xml") 

In this second example it is very hard to be sure that the correct Page Setup dialog is shown.

The only way to be realy sure is to check for the existance of certain control(s) (ID, Class, text, whatever) - but it would be nice to not have to deal with those :-(

Another less declarative (more magic?) is to scan the list of available windows/controls and if they haven't changed then accept that the correct one is shown.

When testing and having XML files then we should use those to make sure that we have the correct dialog up (by using Class/ID)
